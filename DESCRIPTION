Description: This package aims to facilitate the development and dissemination of research related to 
    the efficient valuation of a portfolio of large variable annuities. The package implements a Monte 
    Carlo simulation engine for valuing synthetic portfolios of variable annuities, which reflect 
    realistic features of common annuity contracts in practice. The main valuation methodology was 
    proposed by Guojun Gan and Emiliano A Valdez (2017), 'Valuation of Large Variable Annuity 
    Portfolios: Monte Carlo Simulation and Synthetic Datasets', Dependence Modeling. Vol. 5, 
    pp. 354-374.
