Description: This package aims to facilitate the development and dissemination of research related the 
    efficient valuation of large variable. This package implements a Monte Carlo simulation engine for 
    valuing synthetic portfolios of variable annuities. The synthetic portfolios of variable annuities 
    reflect realitic features of common annuity contracts in practice.
